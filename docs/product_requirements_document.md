Last Updated: January 5, 2026

### Vision
A custom personal website that showcases my personal portfolio.

### Motivation
I would like to host a website to showcase my personal portfolio. I decided to eschew the use of available website templates and web server software and turn my personal website into a full stack project. The objective is to demonstrate my experience with full stack development and software testing in a unique way.

### Goals
- Build a website that introduces myself and shows off my previous work in a visually pleasing manner.
- Design the website such that it supports (renders correctly on) all modern browsers and platforms.

### Non-Goals
- In order to prevent the website's design goals by being held back by technical limitations, the website need not support obsolete browsers and platforms.

### Requirements
- **Technological Modernity:** The website shall implement modern technologies and frameworks to achieve a responsive, high-quality look and feel.
- **Mobile Compatibility:** The website shall adapt to viewing on mobile devices by rearranging elements to suit a vertical screen layout.

### Success Criteria

#### Quantitative Measures:
- **Responsiveness:**
    - First Contentful Paint (time from page load to first content display) shall not exceed 200ms.
    - Largest Contentful Paint (time from page load to when the largest element on the web page loads) shall not exceed 2500ms.

#### Qualitative Measures:
- **Polish:** The webpage delivered shall look and feel professionally made.
